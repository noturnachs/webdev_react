# REACT HOOKS Activity

Objectives of this project:

- Display all the items saved in local storage

- Update an item in the list, and also update that item in local storage.

- Delete an item in the list, and also delete that item from local storage.

- Perform a network request inside a useEffect hook that will trigger once on load, use the response to populate the list, then save the response in local storage.

- On load, check if local storage already contains data. If it does, do not call the API (to prevent repopulating local storage with redundant values). If local storage does not contain any data, only then will you call the API
